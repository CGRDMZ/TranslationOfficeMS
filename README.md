## Description

Aim of the project is to develop a translation app that will help communication between costumers and translators. In the app, users wil be divided into two as costumers and translator. Both of customers and translators must have an account on the app. After creating an account with a username and password, users must sign in. Customers will be able to upload a text and the text will be translated by the translators for a certain fee.

The amount to be paid for the translation depends on the length of the text. Also, the customer will be notified about the approximate deadline of the translation. A customer will be able to upload more than one text. Each text must be uploaded seperately. The customer also will be able to check the situation of uploaded texts.

Translators are the second type of the user. To become a translator in the app, a user must apply for the position, then user’s application must be approved. The translator can start working on a text immediately, if there is any task available. An amount of the fee is given to the translator as payment when the task has been completed. A text is translated sentence by sentence. All data is kept in a database.

This app has been planned in order to complete the translation process much faster and more effectively. Also, the app was inspired from a web site named “Protranslate”.
